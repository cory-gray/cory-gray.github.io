      <h3>Who am I?</h3>

      <p>I am a native of the beautiful commonwealth of Kentucky, where I recently earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky. I am an engineer and an explorer. I am deeply fascinated by math and science, by how much we have achieved using engineering and technology, and by how far we have yet to go.</p>
      <p>I am also mentor and a friend. I enjoy building connections with others, and I strive to have a positive impact on their experiences. At the University of Kentucky, I served as a resident advisor, a <a class="body-link" href="https://www.as.uky.edu/peer-mentors-heart-living-learning-program" target="_blank">peer mentor</a>, and a member of the <a class="body-link" href="http://www.uky.edu/studentsuccess/KCrew" target="_blank">K Crew</a>, developing relationships with students from a wide variety of backgrounds, cultures, and nationalities.  I also had the incredible opportunity to spend time abroad studying art and culture in France, which was invaluable in broadening my perspective, increasing my understanding of others, and cultivating my own self-awareness.</p>

<div class="w3-row w3-padding-16">
      <h3>What do I do?</h3>
      <p>My primary professional motivation is to solve complex problems and craft engaging experiences for others through software. While I have some experience in web development and computer graphics, I work primarily in applications development, using high-level programming languages to create computer programs. I feel most at home programming in C and C++, but I’m also comfortable programming in Java and Python, and I have some familiarity with PHP and R.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite things to do is to solve puzzles; my favorite projects often involve resolving problems in mathematics, probability, and game theory, and I enjoy working on programs that use artificial intelligence to complete tasks of logic; e.g., navigating a maze, solving a puzzle, or playing a game. I’m also a fan of video games, and I enjoy working on them when I get the chance. Perhaps the toughest project I’ve been involved with centered on using big data analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast customer activity at a Lexington café. You can check out that project and some of the other work that I’ve done <a class="body-link" href="http://cory-gray.github.io/projects">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>What is important to me?</h3>

      <h5><b>Education</b></h5>
      <p>Until recently, I spent the majority of my time and focus on pursuing academics. Though I’m now the proud owner of a degree in Computer Science, I continue to strive to gain more knowledge and expose myself to new ideas and experiences. The abundance of free online courses, articles, and tutorials available on the internet is a great boon to anyone who wishes to further their education and engage in continued self-development. I believe that learning is an integral part of life that should be encouraged in all contexts, not just those that take place within a classroom.</p>
      <h5><b>Exploration</b></h5>
      <figure style="float:right; max-width:40%" align="center">
        <img alt="Red River Gorge" src="/media/Gorge.jpg" style="max-width:100%; border-style:solid; border-width:2px; border-color:#808080">
        <figcaption style="text-align:center">The Red River Gorge and Daniel Boone National Forest</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Part of learning is the drive to discover, the desire to overcome personal limits and expand the boundaries of knowledge and experience. Some of my favorite activities are going for a run on a nature trail or hiking through parks and forest areas, such as Kentucky’s <a class="body-link" href="http://www.redrivergorge.com/geological.html" target="_blank">Red River Gorge</a>, or Paris’s <a class="body-link" href="http://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71494/Bois-de-Boulogne" target="_blank">Bois de Boulogne</a>. I am also an ardent supporter of space exploration and astronomical research; I believe the success of future generations will rely upon overcoming the challenges inherent to continuing our ventures into space, challenges that the engineers of today are soon to face.</p>
      <h5><b>Mentorship</b></h5>
      <p>I deeply value the act of mentorship, and most of the extra-curricular roles I’ve served in throughout my life involved acting as a resource for others. I hold a deep appreciation for those who have served as role models in my life and provided guidance when it was needed, and it is important to me that I offer the same service to others when the opportunity arises. In my past, I’ve worked to engage and support others, establish a sense of community, and celebrate diversity in a variety of contexts. Moving forward, I hope that I will continue to find opportunities to build strong relationships with my peers and serve as part of a greater community in the workplace.</p>
